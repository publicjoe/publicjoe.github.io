<h1>Kill Team: Blooded</h1>
<p>The Blooded were once loyal soldiers of the Astra Militarum. However, these brutal killers have rebelled 
    against the Imperium, tempted by the promises of power offered by the Chaos Gods.</p>
<p>This multipart plastic kit allows you to build 10 Traitor Guard operatives, plus a Traitor Enforcer 
    and his Traitor Ogryn. These miniatures can be used as Blooded operatives in games of Kill Team or 
    fielded with Chaos Space Marines armies in games of Warhammer 40,000. This kit includes a huge variety 
    of weapons, heads, and accessories, allowing you to assemble a truly unique squad of ragged rebels</p>
