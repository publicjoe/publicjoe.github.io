      <h1>40k Combat Patrol: Death Korps of Krieg</h1>
      <p>The Warhammer 40,000 Combat Patrol: Death Korps of Krieg is a boxed set designed for players who want to start or expand 
          their Astra Militarum army in the Warhammer 40,000 universe. This set provides a variety of Krieg miniatures, including 
          infantry and cavalry, allowing players to create a balanced and effective force for tabletop battles.</p>
      <p>The Death Korps of Krieg will stop at nothing to prove their loyalty to the Imperium, casting aside their lives in brutal 
          wars of attrition. They rely on the weight of numbers, an unflinching perspective on war and sacrifice, and the use of 
          heavy siege weapons to grind their foes down.</p>
      <p>If you want to sacrifice yourself in the name of the God-Emperor, this box is the perfect way to start a new Death Korps 
          of Krieg collection – or expand an existing army – and save money compared to buying the kits individually. A Command 
          Squad lead the charge, followed by a dependable infantry squad. Heavy weapons provide covering firepower while Death 
          Riders outflank the enemy, ready to strike with their vicious sabres. These 26 plastic miniatures represent a complete 
          Astra Militarum force for use in tight, tactical Combat Patrol games of Warhammer 40,000.</p>
      <p>This boxed set builds 26 multipart plastic Astra Militarum miniatures:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>7x Krieg Command Squad miniatures</li>
        <li>5x Death Riders</li>
        <li>4x Krieg Heavy Weapons Squad miniatures</li>
        <li>10x Death Korps of Krieg soldiers</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The miniatures in this kit are easy to customise. The Death Riders can each be armed with a power sabre, frag lance, or 
        
        Death Rider lascarbine. There are parts to build an optional squad leader, as well as numerous cosmetic parts, including 
        various designs of pouches.</p>
      <p>The Heavy Weapons Squad gunners can be armed with a lascannon, a Krieg heavy flamer, or a twin Krieg heavy stubber, along 
        with interchangeable backpacks and accessories. The Fire Coordinator can be built either leaning on their knee or consulting a 
        map of the battlefield.</p>
      <p>The Death Korps of Krieg squad includes parts to build an optional Watchmaster who can be armed with a plasma pistol, 
        laspistol, or bolt pistol, and a chainsword or power weapon. One miniature can be built as a sniper, one with a flamer, one 
        with a grenade launcher, and one with a plasma gun or meltagun. One squad member can take a vox-caster, another can take 
        a medi-pack, and there are cosmetic accessories, including bayonets, pickaxes, belt pouches, and grenades.</p>
      <p>The Lord Commissar in the Command Squad can be equipped with a plasma pistol or a whip in their right arm, and a powerfist 
        or a sheathed power-sword and pointing hand for their other arm. One Veteran Guardsman in the unit may be assembled with 
        either a laspistol, a bolt pistol, or a plasma pistol in their right hand and a chainsword, power weapon, or trench club 
        in their left hand. Another Guardsman can carry a boltgun, plasma gun, meltagun, or grenade launcher into battle. The 
        remaining Guardsmen carry the regimental standard, master vox, and alchemyk counteragents, respectively. There is also a 
        range of optional cosmetic accessories, including shovels, to further decorate your miniatures.</p>
      <p>This kit comprises 803 plastic components, 1x Citadel 32mm Round Base, 17x Citadel 25mm Round Bases, 5x Citadel 60mm by 
        35.5mm Oval Bases, 3x Citadel 50mm Round Bases, and 1x Death Korps of Krieg Transfer Sheet containing 803 high-quality 
        waterslide transfers to decorate your miniatures.</p>
      <p>These miniatures require assembly and are supplied unpainted – we recommend using Citadel Plastic Glue and Citadel Colour paints.</p>
