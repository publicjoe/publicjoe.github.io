      <h1>Ammit IFV</h1>
      <p>The Ammit IFV is a lightweight tracked vehicle used by Krevarian Mounted Dragoons to keep up with armored formations. 
        Relatively quick and well armored for its size, the Ammit is unfortunately quite cramped for the number of troops it is 
        expected to ferry. The result is a need for auxiliary support vehicles to support Dragoon formations on extended patrols.</p>

      <p>Despite this, the Ammit is well-liked by both its crew and the infantry it carries. Its versatile chassis also lends itself 
        well to modification, and many light armored vehicles share its base chassis and drive.</p>
