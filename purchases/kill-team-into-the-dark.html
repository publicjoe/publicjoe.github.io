          <p>Kill Team: Into the Dark is a boxed set expansion for the miniature skirmish game Warhammer 40,000: 
            Kill Team, published by Games Workshop. Released in 2022, it was the first box set of the game's 
            "second season" and introduced the "Close Quarters" combat rules for fighting inside the narrow 
            confines of a derelict space hulk called the Gallowdark.</p>

          <p><b>Close Quarters rules:</b> Into the Dark changed the gameplay setting from open battlefields to the 
            cramped interiors of a spaceship. The new "Close Quarters" rules focus on brutal, tight-corridor 
            fighting and replace some standard Kill Team mechanics, such as removing vantage points for 
            operatives and introducing interactive doors.</p>

          <p><b>Two new kill teams:</b> The box includes 24 Citadel miniatures, split into two new factions with 
            multiple customization options.</p>

          <div class="content">
            <li><b>Imperial Navy Breachers:</b> An elite Imperial boarding party, equipped with combat shotguns, 
                shields, and other breaching tools.</li>
            <li><b>Kroot Farstalker Kinband:</b> A group of Kroot mercenaries seeking plunder within the space hulk.</li>
          </div>
            
          <p><b>Modular terrain:</b> The set features 54 modular terrain pieces and barricades, which can be 
              configured in a huge variety of layouts to create different rooms and corridors. The terrain was designed 
              to be compatible with future releases in the Gallowdark series.</p>

          <p><b>Game accessories:</b> The box contains everything needed for play, including a double-sided game board, 
              combat gauges, dice, tokens, and two sets of Tactical Ops cards.</p>

          <p><b>Two rulebooks:</b> A copy of the full Kill Team Core Book is included, along with a separate Into the 
              Dark book. The expansion book provides lore for the Gallowdark, rules for the two new teams, and special 
              campaign and mission packs for narrative and matched play.</p>
