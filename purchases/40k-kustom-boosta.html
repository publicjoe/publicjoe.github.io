<h1>Kustom Boosta-blasta</h1>
<p>The Kustom Boosta-blasta is a heavily modified and customized vehicle used by the Orks in the Warhammer 40,000 universe. 
    Orks are known for their love of ramshackle and heavily armed vehicles, and the Kustom Boosta-blasta is no exception. 
    This vehicle is typically built from scavenged parts and is designed to be both fast and heavily armed, making it a formidable presence on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Armed to the grille with guns, blades and greenskins, the Kustom Boosta-blasta is one of the deadliest Ork vehicles around. Ferociously fast, absurdly 
    heavily armed, and boasting the capacity to set things on fire by simply overtaking them, it exemplifies everything the Speed Freeks look for in a vehicle.</p>
<p>Armed with an enormous, turret-mounted rivet gun, this vehicle is bane of heavy infantry and light tanks alike, while up-close, it’ll incinerate 
    hordes with an array of burna exhausts. If anything manages to survive, just charge it and let your spiked ram do the rest…</p>
