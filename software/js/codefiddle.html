<h1>CodeFiddle</h1>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>So I thought about creating a JSFiddle / Codepen clone and how I would build it.
  Without getting into a deep design, I put down some simple initial requirements.</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Left Panel → Tabs for each file (HTML, CSS, JS, etc.) and a code editor area for
    each tab.</li>
  <li>Right Panel → An <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> that shows the live preview generated
    from combining the code in each tab.</li>
  <li>Trigger → As the user edits code, or clicks “Run”, the right panel reloads the iframe
    with the combined code.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tech Stack</h3>
<ul>
  <li>HTML/CSS — Layout and structure.</li>
  <li>JavaScript — Switching tabs, handling code updates, rendering preview.</li>
  <li>CodeMirror or Monaco Editor — For a real code editor experience (syntax highlighting, 
    indenting, etc.).</li>
</ul>

<p>After reading about the two editors, Monaco seem the easiest to get started with.</p>
