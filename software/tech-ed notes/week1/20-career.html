<blockquote>
  <p>“It is incredibly easy to work harder and harder at climbing the ladder of success only to realize that it’s leaning against the wrong wall.”<br>
<em>Stephen R. Covey</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This exercise is here to help you think about what your journey has been up to this point, and where you would like to take things during and after this course, with your new-found skills.</p>

<p>Investing time in this now, up-front, will help you spend more time in more appropriate places for your goals!</p>

<p>A career vision is a clear mental image of who you want to be and what you want to do in the future.</p>

<p>A thought to start you off:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“If everything went as planned, what would your ideal work-life balance look like in 5 years?”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="step-04-accountability-plan">Step 04: Accountability Plan</h3>

<p>💭 How you will track your progress and stay motivated?</p>

  <li>Partner with an accountability buddy.</li>
  <li>Share your goal with friends.</li>
