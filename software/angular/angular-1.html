        <h2>What is Angular?</h2>
        <p>Angular is a popular open-source web application framework developed and maintained 
            by Google. It is designed to make it easier to build dynamic, single-page web 
            applications (SPAs) by providing a robust set of tools and features for developers.</p>
        <p>Angular is built using TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing 
            and other features to the language. This allows developers to write more maintainable 
            and scalable code, while also benefiting from features like type checking and 
            autocompletion.</p>
        <p>Some key features of Angular include:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
          <li>Component-based architecture: Angular applications are built using reusable 
              components, which makes it easier to manage and maintain complex applications.</li>
          <li>Two-way data binding: Angular provides a powerful data binding mechanism that 
              allows changes in the UI to be automatically reflected in the underlying data model, 
              and vice versa.</li>
          <li>Dependency injection: Angular has a built-in dependency injection system that 
              makes it easy to manage and share services and other resources across different 
              parts of the application.</li>
          <li>Routing: Angular includes a powerful routing system that allows developers to 
              create SPAs with multiple views and navigation between them.</li>
          <li>Directives: Angular provides a rich set of directives that allow developers to 
              extend HTML with custom behavior and functionality.</li>
          <li>Improved hydration and SSR performance: Angular 20 introduces enhancements to server-side 
              rendering (SSR) and hydration processes, resulting in faster load times and better 
              performance for web applications.</li>
          <li>Enhanced developer experience: With Angular 20, developers can benefit from improved 
              tooling, better error messages, and streamlined workflows, making the development 
              process more efficient and enjoyable.</li>
          <li>Testing: Angular includes a robust testing framework that makes it easy to write 
              unit tests and end-to-end tests for applications.</li>    
        </ul>
        <p>Overall, Angular is a powerful and flexible framework that can help developers 
            build complex web applications more easily and efficiently.</p>
